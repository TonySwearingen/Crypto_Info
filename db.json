"Description": "Originally formed as a joke, Dogecoin was created by IBM software engineer Billy Markus and Adobe software engineer Jackson Palmer. 
They wanted to create a peer-to-peer digital currency that could reach a broader demographic than Bitcoin. In addition, they wanted to distance it from the controversial history of other coins."

"Description": "Ethereum was initially described in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin,a programmer and co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine, in late 2013
with a goal of building decentralized applications. Buterin argued to the bitcoin core developers that Bitcoin and blockchain technology could benefit
from other applications besides money and needed a more robust language for application development that could lead to attaching real-world assets, 
such as stocks and property, to the blockchain."
